    "statement": "<p>Find the 250th triangular number.</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Starting with a small triangle number might help. Can you use the pattern of triangles and squares to help you? What square could be the sum of the 250th triangle number and another triangle number? Think about the 250th square number and how it relates to the 250th triangle number.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>Let us look at a smaller example first. We could find the 5th triangular number using this square:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_6.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_6\" /></p>\n<p>We are looking for the number of purple squares. We can do <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_7.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_7\" /> to get the pink triangle. And then adding on the 5 squares in the diagonal gives the purple triangle. So we have 15.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_8.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_8\" /></p>\n<p>For 250, we are looking for the number of squares in the black \"triangle\". It will be roughly <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_9.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_9\" />, except that the diagonal will be included. So we can do <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_10.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_10\" /> to find the blue triangle and then add 250 on to find the black triangle. The answer is 31,375.</p>\n<p>We can extend this logic to find a formula for the nth triangular number</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_11.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_11\" /></p>\n<p>Check: <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_12.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_12\" /></p>\n<p>Using the formula, we can also see that consecutive triangle numbers add to a square number. Consecutive triangular numbers can be represented as <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_13.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_13\" /> and <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_14.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_14\" />.</p>\n<p>If we add these consecutive triangular numbers and simplify we can find:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_15.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_15\" /></p>"
