    "statement": "<p>Take a positive integer (whole number). Reverse the digits to get a new number. Add the two numbers together. Repeat this process until you get a palindrome (a number that reads the same forwards and backwards).</p>\n<p>Can you find a starting number that doesn't end up at a palindrome? Nobody knows if this is possible.</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Pick a positive integer (whole number), e.g. 57. Reverse the digits to get 75. Adding gives <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_0.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_0\" />. Then reverse this new number and add together. You get <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_1.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_1\" />. This is a palindrome as it reads the same forwards as backwards, so we stop. Can you find a number that takes longer to reach a palindrome? </p>",
    "explanation": "<p>Some numbers end up in a palindrome after one step, e.g. 243: <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_2.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_2\" />. Some take a bit longer, e.g. 87: <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_3.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_3\" />, <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_4.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_4\" />, <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_5.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_5\" />, <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_6.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_6\" />.</p>\n<p>Some numbers take a very long time \u2013 89 takes an unusually large 24 steps (the most of any number under 10,000) to reach the palindrome 8,813,200,023,188.</p>\n<p>A number is called a Lychrel number if it never reaches a palindrome. No one has proved that a Lychrel number exists. One possibility is 196 - the first billion steps have been carried out by computers and it hasn't reached a palindrome\u2026but this does not prove it never will!</p>"

  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>Can you find different 3-digit numbers that take 1, 2, 3 and 4 steps to become a palindrome?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Most smaller 3-digit numbers take only 1 step to become a palindrome, but try using bigger digits that will mean you have to carry when you add (e.g. <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Lychrel_Numbers_image_7.png\" class=\"Lychrel_Numbers_image_7\" /> so you will have to carry the 1).</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>There are lots of options, but 122 takes 1 step, 109 takes 2 steps, 199 takes 3 steps and 192 takes 4 steps.</p>"

  "additional_information": {
    "about": "<p>If you change the base of the problem to binary then 10110 (22 in decimal) is a Lychrel number. The name Lychrel comes from a rough anagram of Wade Van Landingham's girlfriend Cheryl.</p>",
