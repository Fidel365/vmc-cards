    "hint": "<p>Can you start with a 4\u00d74 square and work out how many squares there are? Remember to keep track of how many 1\u00d71, 2\u00d72, 3\u00d73 and 4\u00d74 squares you find.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>There is one 10\u00d710 square, four 9\u00d79 squares, nine 8\u00d78 squares, sixteen 7\u00d77 squares .... one hundred 1\u00d71 squares, all of which are square numbers. So we need to add all the square numbers from 1 to 100: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385. </p>"
