    "explanation": "<p>The five numbers 1,2,3,4 and 5 add up to 15. If the pattern is continued for 2000 digits there will be 2000/5 = 400 sets of these five numbers. 400*15 = 6000.</p>"

    "hint": "<p>Try dividing 960,000 by 120,000. What does this answer represent?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "15",
    "explanation": "<p>960,000 is the sum of all the digits. There are 120,000 digits, so dividing 960,000 by 120,000 gives us the average of the digits. This is 8, so we are looking for a sequence of numbers 1,2,3,... that has a mean of 8. This must be 1,2,3,...15.</p>"

For example <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/OneTwoThreeFourFive_image_1.png\" class=\"OneTwoThreeFourFive_image_1\" /> can be found by  <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/OneTwoThreeFourFive_image_2.png\" class=\"OneTwoThreeFourFive_image_2\" />. </p>\n<p>The sequence of numbers that this formula gives are called triangular numbers. The first ten are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55. </p>",
