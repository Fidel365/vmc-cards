    "statement": "<p>Pegs numbered 1 to 52 are placed in a circle. Starting with number 2, alternate pegs are knocked down until only one is left.</p>\n<p>What is the number of the last peg to be knocked down?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "41",
    "hint": "<p>What happens if you only had 2 pegs? What about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 pegs? Can you spot the pattern after considering these cases?</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>Starting with only 2 pegs, we know that the last peg to be knocked down would be number 1. We can work out which would be the last peg if we increase the number to start with, record our results and look for a pattern.</p>\n<p>2 - 1</p>\n<p>3 - 3</p>\n<p>4 - 1</p>\n<p>5 - 3</p>\n<p>6 - 5</p>\n<p>7 - 7</p>\n<p>8 - 1</p>\n<p>9 - 3</p>\n<p>And so on. Each power of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,32, \u2026) \"resets\" the last peg standing to be number 1. You can see that the numbers go up in odd numbers after this. To work out for 52, we can do <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Sword_of_Josephus_image_0.png\" class=\"Sword_of_Josephus_image_0\" />. <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Sword_of_Josephus_image_1.png\" class=\"Sword_of_Josephus_image_1\" /> so we can add on 40 to 1 and get the answer 41.  </p>"

    "hint": "<p>What is the biggest power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...) that is less than 2000?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "1953",
    "explanation": "<p>The biggest power of 2 below 2000 is 1024. We need to count up by 2 from there, starting at 1 so the answer is <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Sword_of_Josephus_image_2.png\" class=\"Sword_of_Josephus_image_2\" />.</p>"
