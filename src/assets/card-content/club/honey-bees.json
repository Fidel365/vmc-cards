    "statement": "<p>One gallon of honey provides fuel for one bee to fly about seven million miles.</p>\n<p>Roughly how many bees could fly one thousand miles if they had ten gallons of honey?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "70,000 ",
    "hint": "<p>How far can one bee travel with ten gallons of honey?</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>10 gallons would allow one bee to travel for 70 million miles. <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_0.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_0\" /> so 70,000 bees could travel 1000 miles each.</p>"

  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>Now suppose 4 bees can each travel 6 million miles on 2 gallons of honey. How far could 8 bees each travel with 6 gallons of honey?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>How far can one bee can travel on 1 gallon of honey?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "9,000,000",
    "explanation": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_1.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_1\" />. This is the number of miles one bee can travel on 1 gallon of honey. To find the answer, you can multiply this by 6 to find the total number of miles one bee can travel on 6 gallons of honey and then divide by 8 to find the distance per bee. The answer is <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_2.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_2\" />.</p>"

  "extension_2": {
    "statement": "<p>A worker bee can make a hive of hexagons in 60 minutes, and a queen bee can make the same size hive in 40 minutes. How many minutes will it take them if they do it together?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>It might be easier to choose a number of hexagons to work with - try 120 and work out how many they can each do per minute.</p>",
    "correct_answer": "24",
    "explanation": "<p>We can see this with an example with numbers. If there are 120 hexagons, then the worker bee makes 2 per minute and the queen bee makes 3 per minute. So together they make 5 per minute. <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_3.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_3\" />. It doesn't matter what number of hexagons we start with.</p>\n<p>This can also be considered algebraically. Take the total amount of hexagons as <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_4.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_4\" />. The worker bee will be working at a rate of <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_5.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_5\" /> hexagons per minute, and the queen bee at a rate of <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_6.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_6\" /> minutes. By simply adding the rates together, <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/Honey_Bees_image_7.png\" class=\"Honey_Bees_image_7\" />, we can find the answer, 24 minutes.</p>"
